APT29 is reported to have exploited zero-day vulnerabilities and has pursued actions on the objective using suites of custom malware, coupled with alternate execution methods such as PowerShell and WMI. APT29 has also been known to employ various operational cadences (smash-and-grab vs. slow-and-deliberate) depending on the target's perceived intelligence value.\n",
        "APT29 is reported to have attained initial access by exploiting public-facing applications, phishing, and supply chain compromise. The group is reported to have implemented at least two operational cadences, smash-and-grab and slow-and-deliberate. Different suites of tools and TTPs were employed for each one of these cadences. If a target was determined to be of value, the attackers are reported to have modified TTPs, and deployed a stealthier toolset with the intent or establishing long-term persistent access.\n",
        "The objective of smash-and-grab operations appears to have been rapid collection and exfiltration. As such, soon after achieving an initial foothold, APT29 actors are reported to have performed host-based situational awareness checks, and immediately sought to collect and exfiltrate data. If the host was determined to be of value, a stealth toolkit was deployed and persisted. The attackers are reported to have moved through the network, exfiltrating data and persisting on hosts deemed to be valuable.\n",
        "In their smaller more targeted campaigns, APT29 has utilized a different toolset incrementally modified to attempt to evade published intelligence about their operations.\n",
