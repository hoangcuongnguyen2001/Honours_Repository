menuPass actors are reported to have pursued initial access by spearphishing to achieve user execution. menuPass spearphishing attempts generally assume a pretext that would be of interest to the intended target and are reported to have featured password protected Microsoft Word documents embedded with VBA macros, an executable attachment that exploits a vulnerability, or a link that points to a payload server. Once inside the target organization, menuPass actors have used a variety of open-source, modified open-source, and custom tools to perform discovery, escalate privileges, access credentials, move laterally, and exfiltrate data.
"Operation Cloud Hopper," was a long-term persistent effort to compromise MSPs with the intent of abusing trust relationships in order to pivot into customer networks. menuPass actors are thought to have achieved initial access to MSP networks by spearphishing. From the MSP networks, menuPass actors are reported to have used legitimate but compromised local accounts coupled with legitimate remote access applications to access customer environments. From this initial point of presence, menuPass actors are reported to have used administrative tools native to the Windows environment to download an operational toolkit from an attacker controlled server. This toolkit enabled the pursuit of tactical objectives with the operational intent of exfiltrating intellectual property. This activity will serve as the basis for Scenario 1.
menuPass is also reported to have engaged in phishing campaigns, the most prolific of which were directed against Japanese institutions. Successful compromise resulted in the deployment of menuPass malware to the victim network and the establishment of command and control. menuPass malware has been categorized by the manner in which it was employed by menuPass actors and not necessarily by the malware's inherent functionality. PWC categorized menuPass malware as tactical or sustained. Tactical malware is usually deployed during delivery, or upon initial access, and is intended to perform lightweight tasks, such as discovery and execution. Sustained malware is often modular and has an enhanced set of features. Sustained malware is deployed to specific systems to facilitate a long-term point of presence. menuPass is reported to have leveraged the access facilitated by its malware to pursue operational objectives. This activity will serve as the basis for Scenario 2.
