 OilRig’s tradecraft is notable for their commitment to stealth and persistence in the pursuit of their mission objective. OilRig has demonstrated adeptness in a broad range of attack vectors and a willingness to deviate from their existing arsenal to use novel techniques to accomplish their objectives. OilRig predominantly leverages social engineering as an initial attack vector but has also exploited patched vulnerabilities. Following the 2019 leak of OilRig’s tools and victim data, the group actively evolved their payload arsenal and retooling to avoid detection, creating multiple different malware variants with the same purpose as always: to gain an initial foothold on targeted devices.  
OilRig is reported to have attained initial access via phishing, and credential abuse. After achieving an initial foothold, OilRig actors are reported to use credential dumping tools, such as Mimikatz, to gather legitimate account credentials then move laterally to other systems on the network. OilRig is also known for installing webshells to transfer tools and maintain persistent access to the network.
