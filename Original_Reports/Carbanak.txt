Carbanak is known for persistence and operational patience, waiting before executing illicit funds transfers during their campaigns. Carbanak has taken advantage of system users by launching spearphishing attacks in order to get their malware on target. Carbanak has abused the trust of digital signatures by creating a fake identity in order to obtain valid certificates from a certification authority (CA)4 for their variant of the Anunak malware, which is also called Carbanak. In addition to custom malware, Carbanak has been known to use administrative tools native to the Windows environment, including PowerShell, WMI, and RDP.
Carbanak is reported to begin most breaches with spearphishing and social engineering in order to get a legitimate user to download a Microsoft Word document with malicious files embedded in the document. These embedded files allow Carbanak to establish command and control. They are also known to host malicious files on Google Docs and PasteBin to further expand their command and control. Once on target, Carbanak has been found to rely on using valid accounts to perform most of their actions.  The group is known to move laterally and escalate their privileges across networks to find critical systems that manage financial transactions. Carbanak has been found to target hosts that have specific banking software that would facilitate the illicit funds transfers.6 The group is reported to then establish persistence using Windows native tools, such as scheduled tasks and auto-run services, or other non-malicious tools, such as VNC. From there, Carbanak is known to wait up to four months from initial access before stealing money, using this time to expand access and gather instructions for how to initiate the transfers.
Carbanak is sometimes referred to as FIN7, but these appear to be two groups using the same Carbanak malware and are therefore tracked separately. As such, activity attributed to FIN7 is beyond the scope of this emulation plan.
