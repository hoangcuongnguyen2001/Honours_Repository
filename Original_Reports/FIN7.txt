Regarding their operational tradecraft, FIN7 is distinguished by their techincal innovation, using novel techniques and displaying characteristics of a well-rounded operation. FIN7 has been reported to employ limited use of exploits while blending publicly available and unique or altered tools. The group has leveraged hidden shortcut files (LNK files) to initiate infection and VBScript functionality launched by mshta.exe to infect the victim. This is a departure from previously established usage of weaponized Office macros and highlights the group's ability to adapt to evade detction. 
FIN7 has been reported to use the Carbanak backdoor as a post-exploitation tool since as early as 2015. The group has also used creative persistence mechanisms, such as application shimming, to spawn a Carbanak backdoor and seprately to install a payment card harvesting utility. It has also been reported that the group has developed defense evasion techniques rapidly, such as we creating novel obfuscation methods that in some cases were modified on a daily basis while launching attacks targeting multiple victims. FireEye dubbed their development of a payload obfuscation style using the Windows command interpreter's native string substitution as "FINcoding." 
FIN7 has also used point-of-sale malware, such as Pillowmint, to scrape track 1 and track 2 payment card data from memory.
